# SonarSkys
Final Project for class

Used a pair of Zedboards to pass information using sound signals to fly a quadcopter using a training controller. 
- First zedboard will be connected to the traning controller, capture PPM information, and convert it into sound using the build in Audio CODEC ADAU1761 device connected to a speaker
- Second zedboard will capture the sound using built-in audio device connected to a microphone and decode sound information, translated and sent to a PPM generator, and transmitted to the quadcopter
